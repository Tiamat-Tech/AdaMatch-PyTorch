- Random logit interpolation
    - Use running statistics, or still use batch statistics
    - How about the trainable affine parameters?

- Training
    - Batch size?
    - What does it mean to train for X number of images?
    - Any other optimization hyperparameters? (other than weight decay)

- Data
    - What augmentations used?
    - How to normalize images?

- How to normalize the predicted distribution?
    - L2 norm? Or normal norm? Softmax?


- Why only 25_000 training examples?
